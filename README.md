<h2>APPLICATION PROPOSAL: <h3>NYFTATix (NEW YORK FAKE TRANSIT ASSOCIATION TICKET)</h3></h2>
<p>

<br>
Are app will be designed to allow any indivivual to buy and use a bus or subway fare from thier phone! Strangly enough there is no app implemented for that for New York city, there is one for jersey. This application will make buying a metro card obsolit or help in a pinch. We have already checkd on several applications that already do something similar such as the Metro North Tix application and the New Jersey Ticket applciation.

<br>

Persona 1:
<br>
Details:<br>
   Marie is a young high school student who usually buys her metro card form the school and usually asks for the exact amount to get her home. However Marie was not paying attention one day and missed her stop. This normally would not be a problem but the spacing for this stop was unusally large since it passed a cemetarty. Relizing her mistake Marie got off on the next stop but had no way to catch another bus as her metro card was empty even though she had a credit card and cash.
   <br>
Goals:
<br>
    Marie would have appreciated it if there had been an app like NyFTATix so that she could purchase a ticket from her phone and not have to worry about walking back through the cemetary.
<br>

Persona 2:
<br>
Details:
<br>
 Linda is a 30-year old commuter who is usally a bit forgetfull, and has forgot to bring her metro card with her many times as she has left her house. Only relizing it when she reaches the bus stop andhaving to turn back to retreave it. She has now missed her bus and will have to wait for the next one which won't be around for another 30 mins meaning she will be late to work, again.
<br>
Goals:
<br>
 With this application Linda will no longer need to worry about remebering her metro card as she will now have it on her phone. Now Linda will never miss her bus again or be late to work because of her metro card.

<br>
Features: <br>
 1. Log in/create new account <br>
 2. User will have a profile where card information is stored <br>
 3. Able to purchase and store Tickets (One use/Weekly/Month)<br>
 4. Map Tracking of bus schedule <br>
 5. Color and Bar code that changes daily <br>
 6. Bus and Train Routes <br>
 <br>
 
Market Comparison: <br>
  This application is not completley unique as there a few that function similaraly to it, but what makes it unique is that there is no application set up for the NY public transit system at this time. The applications we are basing this on are the MTAeTix and the NJ TRANSIT Mobile App. The MTAeTix application is a ticket app for the Metro North, which allows a user to purchase a ticket (Signle ride, Weekly, Monthly). Once the pass is activated a new QR code and band of color with date and time apper at the top of the tickit for everyday which allows the ticket master to view and approve. For NJ TRANSIT Mobile application This application is used for all public transit in the area allwoing for ticket purchases and a few of routes and times. We would like to implement these features as well into our application in order to not only have it replace the everyday commuters need for a metro card but also help those who may only needed once in a while
